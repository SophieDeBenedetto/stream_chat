# StreamChat

A Phoenix LiveView application that uses LiveStream to implement a real-time chatting feature. This app is a companion to my blog post on this topic, which you can find here: [https://fly.io/phoenix-files/building-a-chat-app-with-liveview-streams/](https://fly.io/phoenix-files/building-a-chat-app-with-liveview-streams/)

The completed code can be found on the main branch. To follow along with the blog post, checkout the `start` branch.

## Getting Startged

To start your Phoenix server:

* Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
* Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
* Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
